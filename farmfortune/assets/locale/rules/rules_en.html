<p><strong>About slot games</strong></p>
<div>
    <p>This is a game of chance, with dynamic odds, where the player can bet a certain amount of money or credits to try to get combinations of symbols that grant payments.</p>
    <p>The game presents a number of reels or columns, each with a set of symbols that, on each play, stop at a random position, defining which symbols are visible on the screen. Each game has different symbols, both in quantity and appearance, according to its theme and design.</p>
    <p><strong>Basic info</strong></p>
    <p>Usually placed in the upper or lower side of the game, the player can find the session info, which can include:</p>
    <ol>
        <p>-BALANCE: The money or credits the player has in his casino account, available to wager.</p>
        <p>-BET: The value set as the current bet.</p>
        <p>-WIN: The value earned on the last play.</p>
        <p>-PLAY ID: a unique number that identifies each game round. When a new game round starts, this number is updated and remains on screen until the next game round.</p>
    </ol>

    <p><strong>Payouts</strong></p>
    <p>A specified number of like symbols appearing in a selected payline results in a payout. The number of each symbol required, its payout and the paylines patterns available in this game are explained in the Help/Paytable of the game itself.</p>

    <p><strong>Paylines</strong></p>

    <p>The paylines are numbered starting from 1. Some slot machines activate all paylines by default, and others allow player to select the number of active paylines. The amount of active paylines are displayed on the interface of the game and also the controls used for increasing/decreasing the active paylines, if applicable.</p>

    <p><strong>Bet settings</strong></p>

    <p>Games allow player to choose the amount of coins, credits or money to wager. The player can modify the bet using the controls in the bet section (BET/LINE BET/TOTAL BET). In any case, the total wagered per spin is obtained by multiplying the number of coins selected (1 by default) by the coin value or line bet by the number of paylines selected. The bet level also defines the payouts level, according to the paytable.</p>


    <p><strong>Playing the game  </strong></p>
    <p>After the paylines and the bet amount have been set, the player has to put the reels in motion clicking or tapping the SPIN/START button, usually located at the center or right side of the screen. Clicking or tapping this button will start the reel spinning animation, and generate a debit in the player's balance. Once the reels stop, the prizes - if any - will be added to the balance.</p>
    <p>All wins are displayed on screen through the WIN/TOTAL WIN label.</p>

    <p id="auto1"><strong>Autoplay</strong></p>
    <p id="auto2">The player can use the AUTOPLAY controls, to set a number of spins. This function will start each spin automatically until either something that requires the player's intervention occurs or the number of set spins expires.</p>
    <p id="auto3">For some jurisdictions, the autoplay options will include extra settings that allow for an autoplay interruption if the total amount won or lost in that session exceeds a specified amount or if any single win exceeds a specified amount.</p>
    <p><strong>Other controls </strong></p>
    <p>The player is generally able to toggle on/off sound, speed, quality of graphics and other settings, using the controls available on the interface of the game.</p>
